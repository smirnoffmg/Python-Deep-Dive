1. Python Memory Management Overview

Understanding Python's memory allocation and deallocation mechanisms.

The role of Python's memory manager in managing the private heap space.

How Python abstracts memory management from the developer.

2. Memory Allocation Strategies

Understanding blocks, arenas, and pools in Python's memory allocation.

The role of the Python memory allocator for different object sizes.

The concept of 'obmalloc', Pythonâ€™s object-specific memory allocator.

3. Reference Counting

How Python uses reference counting to keep track of object references.

The process of incrementing and decrementing reference counts.

Understanding the implications of reference counting (e.g., immediate object deletion, determinism).

4. Garbage Collection

The need for garbage collection in addition to reference counting.

How the garbage collector identifies and deals with reference cycles.

The generational approach of Python's garbage collector.

Understanding the gc module: manual garbage collection control, thresholds, and uncollectable objects.

5. Memory Leaks

What causes memory leaks in Python and how they manifest.

Common scenarios leading to memory leaks (e.g., reference cycles, global variables).

Techniques and tools for identifying memory leaks (e.g., object tracking, debugging tools).

6. Memory Profiling and Optimization

Tools and techniques for memory profiling in Python (e.g., tracemalloc).

Best practices for writing memory-efficient Python code.

Understanding how different data structures and coding practices impact memory usage.

7. Advanced Concepts

The impact of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) on memory management.

The role of immutability and object sharing in memory efficiency.

Memory management in multi-threading and multi-processing scenarios.
