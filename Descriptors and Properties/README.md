1. Understanding Descriptors

Definition and role of descriptors in Python.

The descriptor protocol: `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods.

How descriptors manage attribute access and assignment.

Use cases for descriptors in Python applications.

2. Implementing Descriptors

Creating custom descriptors for different types of attribute management.

Handling data validation and type enforcement using descriptors.

Best practices for writing reusable and efficient descriptors.

Understanding the relationship between descriptors and Python's class model.

3. Properties as Descriptors

The `property` function as a built-in descriptor type.

Using the `property` decorator to create managed attributes.

Read-only and computed properties.
