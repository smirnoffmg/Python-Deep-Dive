1. Introduction to Profiling

Understanding what profiling is and its importance in Python development.

Differentiating between profiling and debugging.

Overview of the types of profiling: CPU profiling, memory profiling, I/O profiling.

2. CPU Profiling

Tools and techniques for CPU profiling in Python.

Using the `cProfile` and `profile` modules for performance analysis.

Interpreting profiling reports: identifying hotspots and bottlenecks.

3. Memory Profiling

Memory profiling concepts and tools (e.g., `memory_profiler`).

Analyzing memory usage and leaks.

Understanding Python's memory management and garbage collection.

4. Line-by-Line Analysis

Using line profilers (e.g., `line_profiler`) to measure execution time of individual lines.

Strategies for optimizing critical sections of code.

5. Profiling in Real-Time Applications

Profiling web applications and long-running processes.

Real-time profiling and monitoring techniques.

Balancing performance and resource utilization.

6. Visualization of Profiling Data

Tools for visualizing profiling data (e.g., `SnakeViz`, `py-spy`).

Understanding call graphs and flame graphs.

Making data-driven decisions for optimization.

7. Advanced Profiling Techniques

Profiling asynchronous code (`asyncio`).

Profiling multithreaded and multiprocess applications.

Integrating profiling into automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.

8. I/O and Network Profiling

Techniques to profile disk I/O and network-related performance issues.

Tools for tracking I/O operations and optimizing data access patterns.

9. Best Practices in Optimization

How to approach code optimization post-profiling.

Understanding when and where to optimize.

Avoiding premature optimization and maintaining code readability.

10. Practical Exercises and Case Studies

Hands-on exercises to profile and optimize real Python applications.

Case studies of performance issues and their resolution using profiling.
